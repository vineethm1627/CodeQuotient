/*
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is a sum of the prior two. As an illustration, here is a short sequence given starting values of (0, 1) is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).

Write a program to generate and print the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence where n >=1.

Input

Each test case will contains a single integer n where n >=1.
Output

For each input case, generate and print the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
